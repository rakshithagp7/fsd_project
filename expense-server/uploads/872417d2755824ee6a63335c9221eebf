There are two sections to the app, settings and expense dashboard.

User can define a budget in settings in addition to defining different categories in which expenses can be made. Both of these options are in settings page.

Once this setup is done, user can add expenses in any of the categories. A summary page shows the expense trend.

Must have features: 
1. Add expense
2. Edit Expense 
3. Delete Expense ( soft delete, show striked or some other indication that it's deleted, don't remove the entry from the database)
4. Expense and budget summary with chart
5. Settings page
6. User Authentication - Register, Login & Logout 

Good to have extra features:
1. Basic user profile with name, photo and occupation only.
2. Undo delete expense
3. Upload invoice or any image along with expense
4. Download invoice from expense listing.
5. List all deleted expenses 

Things to note: 

- Frontend should be written in React .
- Use Node JS + Express + MongoDB for backed.
- You can use Ant Design or Bootstrap for the UI components.
